üìã NEW CHAT STARTER KIT

1. Project Context (Copy-Paste This)
   PROJECT: SKA Tickets - Multi-Department Ticketing System
   TECH STACK: Laravel 11 + Livewire 3 + Jetstream + Ubold Theme
   CURRENT TASK: Option C Implementation (DRAFT-xxx numbering for drafts)

BACKGROUND:

-   We have a finance ticket system with sequential numbering per department
-   Issue: Deleting draft tickets creates gaps in sequence (C/A-00001, C/A-00002, [deleted], C/A-00004)
-   Solution: Option C - Drafts get "DRAFT-xxx" IDs, only POSTED tickets get sequential numbers

OPTION C REQUIREMENTS:

1. Draft tickets: ticket_no = 'DRAFT-{uniqid}' (e.g., DRAFT-6789abcd)
2. Posted tickets: ticket_no = Sequential (e.g., C/A-00001, C/A-00002)
3. Drafts can be DELETED freely (no impact on sequence)
4. Posted tickets can only be CANCELLED (keeps number, audit trail)
5. Bulk delete: Max 5 drafts at once with warning
6. "My Drafts" section in ticket list
7. Draft expiry: Auto-delete after X days (configurable in settings)
8. Duplicate posted ticket: Creates new draft with confirmation
9. Preview: "Next number will be C/A-00005 when posted"

CODE STANDARDS:

-   Well-commented code with PHPDoc blocks
-   Follow existing project structure
-   Use existing services (TicketNumberService)
-   Maintain Livewire best practices
-   Use existing Enums (TicketStatus, TicketType, etc.)

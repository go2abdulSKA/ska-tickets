-   Sortable columns
-   Action buttons (View, Edit, Delete)
-   Bulk operations (where applicable)
-   Statistics cards (Total, Active, Inactive)
-   Bootstrap pagination

### **Add/Edit Modal**

-   Centered modal (lg size)
-   Clear form layout
-   Validation with error messages
-   Loading states on buttons
-   Cancel & Save buttons

### **View Offcanvas**

-   Slides in from right (400px width)
-   Top section with primary info
-   Multiple information sections
-   Action buttons at bottom
-   Edit & Close buttons

### **Delete Confirmation**

-   Warning icon (red triangle)
-   Entity details display
-   Usage validation
-   Smart messaging
-   Cannot delete vs Can delete states
-   Confirm & Cancel buttons
